Project Description: this program takes in numbers until the user inputs a 0 
It then sorts the numbers using a bubble sort

Compilation instructions: gcc -o foo main.c node.c

Existing bugs: If the user inputs anything other than a number then it muddys up the list.
Also if more than one number is put on one line only the first number gets read
